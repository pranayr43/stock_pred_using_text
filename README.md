building a hybrid model for predicting stocks using  news  and numeric info 

- Download stock data from https://finance.yahoo.com/
- Download text data from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DPQMQH
- we will be provided with huge amount of data of stock prices(hig,low,open and closed prices), we need to take the summay of data and make it stationary for predicting using ARIMA model
- then using text and previous stock prices together we need to merge data and use common regression techniques to predicting future stock
- after testing , we got a good accuracy of 81% on testing data
